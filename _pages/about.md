Hello! Welcome to my webpage. 

![image-left]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/profile.png){: .align-left} 
I love data analysis. And through analysis, I am always thinking about how a person should live. I believe that we should aim to make the world a better place to live. I always want to keep an open mind when approaching everything in the world.

I've shared my projects and thoughts here, so take a look around and feel free to reach out to me.
